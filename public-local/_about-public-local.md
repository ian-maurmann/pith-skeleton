This is the `public-local` folder.

On your local dev setup, you can use this folder as a stand-in for the `public_html` that will be on the web server.

To test on your local dev setup after everything's set up, navigate to this folder in your terminal, and run:

`php -S 127.0.0.1:8080 serve.php`

(Using 8080 as the port number above. Any unused port number should work)
